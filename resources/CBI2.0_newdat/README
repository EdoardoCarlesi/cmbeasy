> Here we present supplementary numerical data for the CBI observations reported by A. C. S. Readhead

> The CBI even binning data (bins 2 to 14) formatted for use with the COSMOMC Markov Chain Monte Carlo
> package (Lewis & Bridle 2002, Phys. Rev. D, 66, 103511) can be found in the compressed tar file
> CBI2.0_newdat.tgz (revised 2006 Aug 25). Note: this replaces the file cbi2.0.tgz (revised 2004 Mar
> 3), in which the Fisher matrix was incorrectly transformed for the offset-lognormal approximation.
> Thanks to Loison Hoi for pointing out the error. For more information, see the discussion in the

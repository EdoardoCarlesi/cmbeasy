<h2>Likelyhood analysis</h2>

<font size="-1">CMBEASY</font>   can perform likelyhood analysis
with on the fly data visualization. You can specify the parameter range
if you click on the <em>likley</page> of the lower tabwidget. <br><br>

For each parameter, you can give a lower and upper bound as well
as the number of steps in this parameter direction. If the number of steps
is one, then the lower bound will be used.For quintessence, you can also
give the amount of dark energy at last scattering.<br><br>

For a quick first try, you may take models out of the precalculated database
<em>this time including quintessence</em> (as opposed to the usual morphing)
by unselecting the <em>cmb</em> checkbox.<br><br>

If the <em>cmb</em> checkbox    is unselected, then the data from the
data base together with the background evolution of the universes is used.
No fluctuations are calculated.

The <em>accoustic</em> scale is inferred along the lines of
astro-ph/0044160.  The same is true for the cluster abundance constraints,
i.e. sigma 8. The supernovaes (SN1a) are independent of the model data base
and anyhow given by the background  evolution [in fact, SN1a are somewhat "blind"
if the product w*(Omega_dark ^ 1.4) is the same for different models].

<h2>The first quick likelyhood</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Keep everything in the page as it is <em>except for the number of steps</em>.
I suggest selecting between 3 and 5 for a first try. Keep <em>cmb</em>
unselected and in the <em>dark energy page above</em> select Lambda, if it
is not already selected.</li>
<li>
Now hit the <em>do likelyhood</em> button.</li>
<li>
The status bar on the bottom of the window keeps you informed about the
progress.
</li>
<li>
<font color="red">If anything goes wrong,</font> a dialog will pop up and tell you that
morphing has not been possible. This mostly happens because the parameter space
stored in the model data base is not big enaugh.
</li>
<li>
If everything went alright, you can now press the <em>marginalize button</em>.
BTW: you can marginalize as often as you want to as soon as the likelyhood calculation
has finished. Try it !
</li>
<li>
In the <a href="marginalizedialog.html">Marginalize Dialog</a>, choose one X and one
Y axis, marginalize over the others (you can also select one specific value, instead of
marginalizing).
</li>
<li>
To actually see the likelyhood, select the likelyhood page in the plot tabwidet.
</li>
<li>
<font color="red">By (un)selecting <em>peak</em>,<em>SN1a</em> and <em>sigma8</em>
the likelyhood will on the fly be built up by the product of the likelyhoods of the selected
methods.</font> It is instructive to see in real time the effects of the various methods.

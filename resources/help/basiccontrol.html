<h2>The Basic control panel</h2>

Here, there are several checkboxes controling the kind of
calculation CMBEASY will perfrom if you press the start button.
In detail, they are:
<ol>
  <li>scalar:  Perform scalar CMB spectrum calculation</li>
  <li>tensor: Perform tensor CMB spectrum calculation </li>
  <li>power: Perform cold dark matter powerspectrum calculation</li>
  <li>lensed: Incooperate the lensing influence on the spectras using linear theory</li>
  <li>adjust: Force Omega=1. This is for your convenience. The vacuum energy will interactivly
  adjusted to meet this constraint whenever you change Omega_cdm org Omega_baryon.</li>
  <li>morphing: This is the king of all controls :-) When checked, CMBEASY will try and use precalculated
        data and morph the spectra to give very fast results. The big advantage is speed. The drawbacks are:
        <ul>
       <li>           It is somewhat inaccurate (not too much, but still)</li>
       <li>Only vaccuum energy as dark energy is allowed.</li>
       <li>There will be no tensor specta</li>
        </ul>                                                        </li>
</ol>

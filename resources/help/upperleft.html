                                           <h2>The Plots</h2>

 The plots come as <em>pages</em>
within a tabwidget.   <br><br>
                  <h3>   Scalar, tensor and power spectra plots</h3>
The <em>scalar</em> ,
 <em> tensor</em> and
  <em>power</em>  pages contain the results of the CMB calculation for the scalar
 and tensor modes and the COBE normalized cold dark matter power spectrum.
 Whenever the mouse pointer is close to one of the curves, the curve will
 be highlighted and the info in the lower part of the main window will be updated
 to show the parameters of this curve. On pressing the right mouse button,
 a menu will appear in which you can:<br><br>
 <ol>
   <li>Specificall ask for the parameters (info). The info page will show up, if it is
        hidden.</li>
 <li>Invoke cosmos. This is only possible for curves generated by morphing. In this
 case, cosmos will be asked to calculate the background evolution of the universe with
 the parameters of the given curve. The sound horizon, age of the universe etc. will then
 appear in the info page.</li>
 <li>
 Save curve. You will be asked to enter a file name under which this curve will be saved
 in the usual collumn format usable for e.g. gnuplot. First collumn: X-Data, Second collumn Y-Data.
 </li>
 <li>Cut curve. This removes this curve (and to be more precise, all of the curves with corresponding
 to this universe) from the plot. In other words: Cutting in the scalar plot will also cut the curve in the
 powerspectrum plot.
 </li>
 </ol>
                                                  <br><br>
 When no curve is highlighted,  pressing the right mouse button will create a popup menu
 in which you can choose to either print this plot using gnuplot or the QT library. In general,
 using gnuplot will give nicer results. However, for the likelyhood plot, the QT printing is the
 only way.


 <h3>Likelyhood plots</h3>
The likelyhood plots are shaded areas of 1 and 2 sigma likelyhood. The axis are specified
by using the marginalize dialog. Printing is only possible using the QT library. The checkboxes
in the liley page of the tabwidget in the lower half of the mainwindow determine which type
of observations (SNeIa etc.) should be used. For more, see "performing likelyhoods".

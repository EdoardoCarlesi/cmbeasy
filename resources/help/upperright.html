<h2>The upper right block</h2>
In this block, there is a tabwidget containing settings for
all cosmological parameters. <br><br>

<h3>Background page<h3>
In the <em>background</em> page, you can specify the relative
energy content baryon, cold dark matter, and energy (denoted
as lambda) and massive neutrinos.
For cold dark matter and baryons, you can either specify
Omega, or Omega times h^2. Whenever you change one of them, the
other follows (depending on the current value of h).
<br>               <br>
In addition, you can specify the hubble parameter in units of 100 km/(Mpc s)
and  the number of massive neutrino species.
<br><br>
If the adjust-checkbox in the basic control panel is checked, then the
vaccum energy will be adjusted such that in total Omega = 1. If you edit
Omega_Lambda, the cold dark matter will be adjusted to meet this demand.

<h3>Spectral page</h3>
Here, you can specify the spectral index of scalar and tensor perturbations.
The tensor to scalar quadrupole ratio can be fixed to be given by 7(1-n_s).
If this is not checked, an explizit value can be given.<br><br>
Also on this page, you can set the <em>optical depth to the last scattering surface</em>.

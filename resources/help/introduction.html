<h2>Introduction</h2>


<font size="-1">CMBEASY</font> solves the linearized perturbation equations
in a flat Friedman universe. It is derived from the public <font size="-1">CMBFAST</font>
code by Uros Seljak and Matias Zaldarriaga. <font size="-1">CMBEASY</font>
can be used with or without a graphical frontend. If you use the command line version,
it behaves pretty much like the original  <font size="-1">CMBFAST</font> code.     <br><br>

This documentation describes the use of the graphical frontend.        <br><br>

<h3> Interactive help: Tooltips and What's this? </h3>
Tooltips with short help texts will appear throughout the program, whenever the
mouse pointer is above a certain input widget. If the helptext contains "[more]" then
a larger help text will be displayed if you choose "What's this ?" from either the
help menu, the Toolbar just below the menu bar, or by just pressing
the F2 key.

This is a README for the .newdat format used for the BOOMERANG 03 NA data
release. 

If you use the Boomerang data contained in this file, please
acknowledge your use of it by citing the publication(s) relevant to
the power spectra you use:  
	<TT> : Jones et al 2005 (submitted ApJ)
	<TE> : Piacentini et al 2005 (submitted ApJ)
	<EE> : Montroy et al 2005 (submitted ApJ)

General references to the Boomerang instrument, flight and maps can be
made by citing Masi et al 2005 (submitted A&A)

The best parameter extraction using these results has been carried out
by the Boomerang team and described in MacTavish et al 2005 (submitted
ApJ); you are welcome to attempt to improve on it, but please do so
with care. If you wish to check your results and cite our work
accordingly, please cite: Mactavish et al 2005

The zipped tar file will expand into a data/ directory containing the
current NA result .newdat file (B03_NA_21July05.newdat) with the window
functions for each band placed in the data/windows/ subdirectory
following the COSMOMC convention. The next COSMOMC public release
will contain an updated subroutine capabable of reading the .newdat format
(http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/). 

If you have any questions regarding this data set or its use please
contact Carrie MacTavish (cmactavi@cita.utoronto.ca)

Description of .newdat format:  

Header:
-------
line 1:	root filename for window functions placed in windows directory
line 2:	number of bands in each pol type (ordering: TT EE BB EB TE TB)
line 3:	calibration flag (1/0), recalibration factor (in temperature),
	calibration error (in power)
line 4:	beam error flag (1/0),  beam size (arcmins),
	beam error (arcmins)
	The beam error is treated as a gaussian error for each band at
	l_eff. The calibration and beam error marginalization are
        described in (Lewis and Bridle 2002 PRD 66) 
line 5:	likelihood type:	0 == Gaussian 
				1 == all bands offset lognormal
				2 == select bands offset lognormal

Band powers:
------------
this is followed by the bandpowers for each included polarization type
ordered as above. Each type is preceded by a flag (e.g. TT) the
columns represent

band num, power, +err, -err, offset, l_eff+1,l_eff-1, offset flag

where 'offset' is the lognormal offset to be used for the offset
lognormal approximation to the band power likelihoods, and 'offset
flag' determines selectively which bands will be transformed to offset
lognormal for the likelihood evaluation.

Band to band correlations:
--------------------------
Each pol type is followed by the block diagonal part of the total
normalized correlation matrix for that pol type bands. i.e. this shows
the band to band correlations for each pol type.

Full inverse Fisher matrix:
---------------------------
At the end of the file the full n_band x n_band inverse Fisher matrix
id ouput row by row. This contains the covariance for the full data
set from the simultaneous determination of the best fit band powers of
all included pol types. 

Window functions:
-----------------
the window functions are placed in the windows subdirectory and follow
the cosmomc format i.e. they are W_l/l where W_l is the band power
window function as defined in MacTavish et al. 2005. The ordering of
the columns is: TT TE EE BB (i.e. COSMOMC ordering)

From version 2.1 on, the output of the monte carlo and
some other stuff from history (which you may like to plot)
is written into this directory.

The main directory would otherwise be cluttered with
too many output files.

If you do not like this, you may erase this directory and
put a symbolic link instead pointing to the CMBEASY
directory.
